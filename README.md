An ESP32 dev board with the footprint and pinout of a Pro Micro, plus a Qwiic connector?! What's not to love?

The PsyFi32 is based on the Sparkfun ESP32 Thing and the Sparkfun Pro Micro.

To use with the Arduino IDE, install Espressif's ESP32 Arduino core. https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32

For our Mocap suit demo, we used Wire library files transplanted from Stickbreaker's ESP32 Arduino Core fork. https://github.com/stickbreaker/arduino-esp32/tree/Wire-Destructor#development-status
